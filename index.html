          Needs to be sleeker. Can you make it stand out more? There is too much white space. I really like the colour
          but can you change it? I'll know it when I see it. You are the designer, you know what to do. Can you make the
          logo bigger? This red is too red. Exactly like that, but different. I love it, but can we go back to the first
          one, that was the best version. I think we need to start from scratch.

          Can you lower the price? There's no budget for this, I hope you understand. You will get a lot of exposure
          doing this. We are a big name to have in your portfolio. We will promote you to our contacts. Can you lower
          the price? Can we barter services? Do we really need a contract? I know this is the final release but can we
          add more features? I got your invoice, it seems really high.

          You code? I have a business idea! If you do the coding part, I'll handle the admin side. No, I can't pay you,
          but I'll give you a percentage of the profits. I really think this could make us rich. I think it should be
          fairly easy. Sorry, I can't tell you what it is, you might steal the idea. But it will be bigger than
          Facebook. Don't you want to be rich?
