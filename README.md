# Profile Example

## The content

This is a static website, meaning it's delivered to the web browser exactly as it's stored. It's made using regular HTML and CSS, with a sprinkling of Javascript to make the dark mode toggle switch and to hide the down arrow on scroll. The site is hosted on [Github pages](https://github.com/benschem/profile).

## The styling

The CSS that styles my index page is composed of two parts - a _Normalise_ section, which aims to render elements more intuitively and consistently, and a _Page Styling_ section, which is where the magic happens.

I have tried to use modern CSS techniques and attempted to follow best practises regarding responsiveness. I hope this can serve as a good inspiration and example for you to follow with your own profile.

## The icons

I used [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/), a collection of simple, free, open-source icons. At it's core, Feather is a collection of SVG files that get inserted into the page with Javascript. I've chosen to load Feather from a CDN provider via a <script> tag in the head of my HTML.

## The images

The images are all AI generated using [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create) and [Adobe Firefly](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/firefly/features/text-to-image.html). I used [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) to resize the images and convert them to .webp to make the filesizes as small as possible so they load faster.
